## Count de Money

Count de Money is a rich old man whose favorite pastime is figuring out how much his coins are
worth. He’s got buckets of coins and likes to pull them out, one at a time, and drop them into
the counter. Then he can see how many coins he has and how much they’re worth.

The Count de Money page will allow the users to add and subtract from each of 4 types of coins
(pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters). Each time the user changes the number of a coin, (s)he will
be able to see the result of the change to the value of the collection.
